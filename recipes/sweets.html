    <h1>Grandma Zilda's Sweets</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg of Thaloxane Plant (local to Machudgai, similar to ephedrine source)</li>
            <li>5 liters of Liquid Lumina (analogous to hydriodic acid)</li>
            <li>500 grams of Crystal Magnesium (similar to magnesium turnings)</li>
            <li>3 liters of Machudgai Solar Water (pure, distilled water)</li>
            <li>1 cup of Refined Ether Essence (to enhance sweetness)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of Star Dust (optional, for extra purity and flavor)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3> 
    <strong>Extraction of Thaloxane</strong> 
        <p>
            ✨ Place the Thaloxane Plant in a large container. Add Machudgai Solar Water until the plant is fully submerged.<br>
            ✨ Heat gently over a low flame for 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until the Thaloxane is fully extracted.<br>
            ✨ Filter the mixture through an Ether Foam cloth to remove plant material, leaving a clear Thaloxane solution.<br>
        </p>  
    <strong>Reduction and reaction</strong>
        <p>
            ✨ In a sturdy reaction vessel, combine the Thaloxane solution with Liquid Lumina. Stir well.<br>
            ✨ Gradually add the Crystal Magnesium while continuing to stir. The mixture will react and begin to bubble.<br>
            ✨ Maintain a steady heat and stir continuously until the reaction subsides and the mixture becomes clear.<br> 
        </p>
    <strong>Purification</strong>
        <p>
            ✨ Carefully filter the mixture through a fine Ether Mesh to remove any impurities.<br>
            ✨ Slowly evaporate the liquid over a low heat, allowing the pure meth crystals to form at the bottom of the vessel.<br>
        </p>
    <strong>Crystallization</strong>
        <p>
            ✨ Once the liquid has fully evaporated, gently scrape the pure meth crystals from the vessel.<br>
            ✨ Dissolve the crystals in Refined Ether Essence to enhance the sweetness, then allow to recrystallize.<br>
        </p>
    <strong>Final Purity Check</strong>
        <p>
            ✨ Optionally, sprinkle a tablespoon of Star Dust over the recrystallized meth for extra purity and a slight flavor boost.<br>
            ✨ Store the final product in an airtight, lightproof container to preserve its purity and sweetness.<br>

    <strong>Grandma Zilda's Tips for Sweetness</strong>
        <p>
        <em>
            ✨ "The key to the sweetest meth is in the careful, slow evaporation process. Patience ensures purity."<br>
            ✨ "Using the freshest Thaloxane and purest Liquid Lumina will make a significant difference in flavor."<br>
            ✨ "Remember, this meth is for special occasions and should be enjoyed responsibly with loved ones."<br>
        </em>
